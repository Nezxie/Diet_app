App to randomly choose your dinner and help you eat healthier

Hi!
This app was (is?) created to help you when you have no idea what you want to eat!
If you press a button it randomly picks a meal for you, displaying all the ingredients you need and how to cook it.

You can also add your own meals by pressing another button. It will open a window in which you can write everything about your meal.
If you hit "done" button your meal will be saved in the database.
You can't delete meals right now, and it's not my priority but i might add it later (but it will be dificult because the DB is just a file - it's not inside code.

App is now in polish language and right now I'm not intending to translate it, but if it turns out great i might.


In the future i want to add filters so you can choose if you want a hot or cold meal, vegan or not, sweat or spicy etc.
I also want to add database of all the products and their kcal and macros. 
I would like to add a functionality that can choose a whole day or week for you while balancing desired calorie count and being healthy.
So basicly an automated dietetician :D
But i don't know if i will be able to do it, cause my code is a mess right now, and i apologize for it truly.

Anyway, who reads README files?
Enjoy my code or my app and have a nice day.
